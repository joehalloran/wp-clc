			    	<p>Children record learning through photographs, written records and audio recordings, which are then tagged by subject or responses to the topic. Pupils are then encouraged to review and reflect on these records over time with teachers and peers. Teachers can also look across these tags to get an overview of the areas that pupils are enjoying or struggling with, and identify specific pupil needs. This helps pupils, and their teachers, understand and develop strategies for learning. London CLC has worked in partnership with Rosendale School and the National Educational Trust to develop the ReflectED approach.</p>
